Welcome!

In this tutorial, we are going to teach you about Geis fundamentals - the language syntax, how to define modules, how to manipulate the characteristics of common data structures, and more. This chapter will focus on ensuring that Geis is installed and that you can successfully run Geis's Interactive Shell, called IEx.
