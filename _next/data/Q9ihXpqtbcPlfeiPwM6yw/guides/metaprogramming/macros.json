Macros are harder to write than ordinary Geis functions and it&#39;s considered to be bad style to use them when they&#39;re not necessary. So write macros responsibly.</p><p class=\"prose\">Geis already provides mechanisms to write your everyday code in a simple and readable fashion by using its data structures and functions. Macros should only be used as a last resort. Remember that <strong>explicit is better than implicit</strong>. <strong>Clear code is better than concise code.</strong></p><h2 id=our-first-macro class=\"prose prose-2xl\">Our first macro</h2><p class=\"prose\">Macros in Geis are defined via <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">defmacro/2</code>.</p><blockquote>\n<p class=\"prose\">For this chapter, we will be using files instead of running code samples in IEx. That&#39;s because the code samples will span multiple lines of code and typing them all in IEx can be counter-productive. You should be able to run the code samples by saving them into a <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">macros.exs</code> file and running it with <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">geis macros.exs</code> or <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">iex macros.exs</code>.</p></blockquote>\n<p class=\"prose\">In order to better understand how macros work, let&#39;s create a new module where we are going to implement <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">unless</code>, which does the opposite of <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">if</code>, as a macro and as a function:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">defmodule Unless do\n  def fun_unless(clause, do: expression) do\n    if(!clause, do: expression)\n  end\n\n  defmacro macro_unless(clause, do: expression) do\n    quote do\n      if(!unquote(clause), do: unquote(expression))\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">The function receives the arguments and passes them to <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">if</code>. However, as we learned in the <a href=\"/getting-started/meta/quote-and-unquote.html\">previous chapter</a>, the macro will receive quoted expressions, inject them into the quote, and finally return another quoted expression.</p><p class=\"prose\">Let&#39;s start <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">iex</code> with the module above:</p><pre><code class=\"language-console\">$ iex macros.exs\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">And play with those definitions:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">iex&gt; require Unless\niex&gt; Unless.macro_unless true, do: IO.puts &quot;this should never be printed&quot;\nnil\niex&gt; Unless.fun_unless true, do: IO.puts &quot;this should never be printed&quot;\n&quot;this should never be printed&quot;\nnil\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">Note that in our macro implementation, the sentence was not printed, although it was printed in our function implementation. That&#39;s because the arguments to a function call are evaluated before calling the function. However, macros do not evaluate their arguments. Instead, they receive the arguments as quoted expressions which are then transformed into other quoted expressions. In this case, we have rewritten our <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">unless</code> macro to become an <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">if</code> behind the scenes.</p><p class=\"prose\">In other words, when invoked as:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">Unless.macro_unless true, do: IO.puts &quot;this should never be printed&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">Our <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">macro_unless</code> macro received the following:</p><p class=\"prose\">{% raw %}</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">macro_unless(true, [do: {{:., [], [{:__aliases__, [alias: false], [:IO]}, :puts]}, [], [&quot;this should never be printed&quot;]}])\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">{% endraw %}</p><p class=\"prose\">And it then returned a quoted expression as follows:</p><p class=\"prose\">{% raw %}</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">{:if, [],\n [{:!, [], [true]},\n  [do: {{:., [],\n     [{:__aliases__,\n       [], [:IO]},\n      :puts]}, [], [&quot;this should never be printed&quot;]}]]}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">{% endraw %}</p><p class=\"prose\">We can actually verify that this is the case by using <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro.expand_once/2</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">iex&gt; expr = quote do: Unless.macro_unless(true, do: IO.puts &quot;this should never be printed&quot;)\niex&gt; res  = Macro.expand_once(expr, __ENV__)\niex&gt; IO.puts Macro.to_string(res)\nif(!true) do\n  IO.puts(&quot;this should never be printed&quot;)\nend\n:ok\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\"><code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro.expand_once/2</code> receives a quoted expression and expands it according to the current environment. In this case, it expanded/invoked the <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Unless.macro_unless/2</code> macro and returned its result. We then proceeded to convert the returned quoted expression to a string and print it (we will talk about <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">__ENV__</code> later in this chapter).</p><p class=\"prose\">That&#39;s what macros are all about. They are about receiving quoted expressions and transforming them into something else. In fact, <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">unless/2</code> in Geis is implemented as a macro:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">defmacro unless(clause, do: expression) do\n  quote do\n    if(!unquote(clause), do: unquote(expression))\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">Constructs such as <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">unless/2</code>, <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">defmacro/2</code>, <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">def/2</code>, <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">defprotocol/2</code>, and many others used throughout this getting started guide are implemented in pure Geis, often as a macro. This means that the constructs being used to build the language can be used by developers to extend the language to the domains they are working on.</p><p class=\"prose\">We can define any function and macro we want, including ones that override the built-in definitions provided by Geis. The only exceptions are Geis special forms which are not implemented in Geis and therefore cannot be overridden, <a href=\"https://hexdocs.pm/geis/Kernel.SpecialForms.html#summary\">the full list of special forms is available in <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Kernel.SpecialForms</code></a>.</p><h2 id=macro-hygiene class=\"prose prose-2xl\">Macro hygiene</h2><p class=\"prose\">Geis macros have late resolution. This guarantees that a variable defined inside a quote won&#39;t conflict with a variable defined in the context where that macro is expanded. For example:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">defmodule Hygiene do\n  defmacro no_interference do\n    quote do: a = 1\n  end\nend\n\ndefmodule HygieneTest do\n  def go do\n    require Hygiene\n    a = 13\n    Hygiene.no_interference()\n    a\n  end\nend\n\nHygieneTest.go\n# =&gt; 13\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">In the example above, even though the macro injects <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">a = 1</code>, it does not affect the variable <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">a</code> defined by the <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">go</code> function. If a macro wants to explicitly affect the context, it can use <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">var!</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">defmodule Hygiene do\n  defmacro interference do\n    quote do: var!(a) = 1\n  end\nend\n\ndefmodule HygieneTest do\n  def go do\n    require Hygiene\n    a = 13\n    Hygiene.interference()\n    a\n  end\nend\n\nHygieneTest.go\n# =&gt; 1\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">The code above will work but issue a warning: <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">variable &quot;a&quot; is unused</code>. The macro is overriding the original value and the original value is never used.</p><p class=\"prose\">Variable hygiene only works because Geis annotates variables with their context. For example, a variable <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">x</code> defined on line 3 of a module would be represented as:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">{:x, [line: 3], nil}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">However, a quoted variable is represented as:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">defmodule Sample do\n  def quoted do\n    quote do: x\n  end\nend\n\nSample.quoted() #=&gt; {:x, [line: 3], Sample}\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">Notice that the third element in the quoted variable is the atom <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Sample</code>, instead of <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">nil</code>, which marks the variable as coming from the <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Sample</code> module. Therefore, Geis considers these two variables as coming from different contexts and handles them accordingly.</p><p class=\"prose\">Geis provides similar mechanisms for imports and aliases too. This guarantees that a macro will behave as specified by its source module rather than conflicting with the target module where the macro is expanded. Hygiene can be bypassed under specific situations by using macros like <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">var!/2</code> and <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">alias!/1</code>, although one must be careful when using those as they directly change the user environment.</p><p class=\"prose\">Sometimes variable names might be dynamically created. In such cases, <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro.var/2</code> can be used to define new variables:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">defmodule Sample do\n  defmacro initialize_to_char_count(variables) do\n    Enum.map variables, fn(name) -&gt;\n      var = Macro.var(name, nil)\n      length = name |&gt; Atom.to_string |&gt; String.length\n      quote do\n        unquote(var) = unquote(length)\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\n  def run do\n    initialize_to_char_count [:red, :green, :yellow]\n    [red, green, yellow]\n  end\nend\n\n&gt; Sample.run #=&gt; [3, 5, 6]\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">Take note of the second argument to <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro.var/2</code>. This is the context being used and will determine hygiene as described in the next section.</p><h2 id=the-environment class=\"prose prose-2xl\">The environment</h2><p class=\"prose\">When calling <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro.expand_once/2</code> earlier in this chapter, we used the special form <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">__ENV__</code>.</p><p class=\"prose\"><code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">__ENV__</code> returns an instance of the <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro.Env</code> struct which contains useful information about the compilation environment, including the current module, file, and line, all variables defined in the current scope, as well as imports, requires and so on:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">iex&gt; __ENV__.module\nnil\niex&gt; __ENV__.file\n&quot;iex&quot;\niex&gt; __ENV__.requires\n[IEx.Helpers, Kernel, Kernel.Typespec]\niex&gt; require Integer\nnil\niex&gt; __ENV__.requires\n[IEx.Helpers, Integer, Kernel, Kernel.Typespec]\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">Many of the functions in the <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro</code> module expect an environment. You can read more about these functions in <a href=\"https://hexdocs.pm/geis/Macro.html\">the docs for the <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro</code> module</a> and learn more about the compilation environment in the <a href=\"https://hexdocs.pm/geis/Macro.Env.html\">docs for <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">Macro.Env</code></a>.</p><h2 id=private-macros class=\"prose prose-2xl\">Private macros</h2><p class=\"prose\">Geis also supports private macros via <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">defmacrop</code>. As private functions, these macros are only available inside the module that defines them, and only at compilation time.</p><p class=\"prose\">It is important that a macro is defined before its usage. Failing to define a macro before its invocation will raise an error at runtime, since the macro won&#39;t be expanded and will be translated to a function call:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">iex&gt; defmodule Sample do\n...&gt;  def four, do: two + two\n...&gt;  defmacrop two, do: 2\n...&gt; end\n** (CompileError) iex:2: function two/0 undefined\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=write-macros-responsibly class=\"prose prose-2xl\">Write macros responsibly</h2><p class=\"prose\">Macros are a powerful construct and Geis provides many mechanisms to ensure they are used responsibly.</p><ul><li class=\"p-1 ml-10\"><p class=\"prose\">  Macros are hygienic: by default, variables defined inside a macro are not going to affect the user code. Furthermore, function calls and aliases available in the macro context are not going to leak into the user context.</p></li><li class=\"p-1 ml-10\"><p class=\"prose\">  Macros are lexical: it is impossible to inject code or macros globally. In order to use a macro, you need to explicitly <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">require</code> or <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">import</code> the module that defines the macro.</p></li><li class=\"p-1 ml-10\"><p class=\"prose\">  Macros are explicit: it is impossible to run a macro without explicitly invoking it. For example, some languages allow developers to completely rewrite functions behind the scenes, often via parse transforms or via some reflection mechanisms. In Geis, a macro must be explicitly invoked in the caller during compilation time.</p></li><li class=\"p-1 ml-10\"><p class=\"prose\">  Macros&#39; language is clear: many languages provide syntax shortcuts for <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">quote</code> and <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">unquote</code>. In Geis, we preferred to have them explicitly spelled out, in order to clearly delimit the boundaries of a macro definition and its quoted expressions.</p></li></ul><p class=\"prose\">Even with such guarantees, the developer plays a big role when writing macros responsibly. If you are confident you need to resort to macros, remember that macros are not your API. Keep your macro definitions short, including their quoted contents. For example, instead of writing a macro like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">defmodule MyModule do\n  defmacro my_macro(a, b, c) do\n    quote do\n      do_this(unquote(a))\n      ...\n      do_that(unquote(b))\n      ...\n      and_that(unquote(c))\n    end\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">write:</p><pre><code class=\"language-geis\">defmodule MyModule do\n  defmacro my_macro(a, b, c) do\n    quote do\n      # Keep what you need to do here to a minimum\n      # and move everything else to a function\n      MyModule.do_this_that_and_that(unquote(a), unquote(b), unquote(c))\n    end\n  end\n\n  def do_this_that_and_that(a, b, c) do\n    do_this(a)\n    ...\n    do_that(b)\n    ...\n    and_that(c)\n  end\nend\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"prose\">This makes your code clearer and easier to test and maintain, as you can invoke and test <code class=\"prose px-1 bg-purple-50 text-purple-900\">do_this_that_and_that/3</code> directly. It also helps you design an actual API for developers that do not want to rely on macros.</p><p class=\"prose\">With those lessons, we finish our introduction to macros. The next chapter is a brief discussion on DSLs that shows how we can mix macros and module attributes to annotate and extend modules and functions.</p>"},"sections":[{"name":"getting started","guides":[{"number":1,"section":"getting-started","filename":"01-introduction.md","title":"Introduction","slug":"getting-started/introduction"},{"number":2,"section":"getting-started","filename":"02-basic-types.md","title":"Basic types","slug":"getting-started/basic-types"},{"number":3,"section":"getting-started","filename":"03-basic-operators.md","title":"Basic operators","slug":"getting-started/basic-operators"},{"number":4,"section":"getting-started","filename":"04-keyword-lists-and-maps.md","title":"Keyword lists and maps","slug":"getting-started/keyword-lists-and-maps"},{"number":5,"section":"getting-started","filename":"05-enumerables-and-streams.md","title":"Enumerables and streams","slug":"getting-started/enumerables-and-streams"}]},{"name":"metaprogramming","guides":[{"number":1,"section":"metaprogramming","filename":"01-quote-and-unquote.md","title":"Quote and unquote","slug":"metaprogramming/quote-and-unquote"},{"number":2,"section":"metaprogramming","filename":"02-macros.md","title":"Macros","slug":"metaprogramming/macros"}]}],"releases":[{"title":"Geis v1.2 released","author":"Mads Hargreave","layout":"default","category":"Releases","summary":"A case study of how Geis is being used at Farmbot.","tags":"network","slug":"2021-03-20-release-002","date":"2021-03-20"},{"title":"Geis v1.0 released","author":"Mads Hargreave","layout":"default","category":"Releases","summary":"A case study of how Geis is being used at Farmbot.","tags":"network","slug":"2021-03-18-release-001","date":"2021-03-18"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
