The theory is demonstrated through a simplistic example that is gradually expanded throughout the book into a fully standalone releasable system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"clear\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003ch4 class=\"resource\"\u003eAdopting Geis\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\u003cp class=\"prose\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"cover\" href=\"https://pragprog.com/book/tvmgeis/adopting-geis\" title=\"Adopting Geis: From Concept to Production\n– by Ben Marx, José Valim, Bruce Tate\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/images/learning/adopting-geis.jpg\" alt=\"Programming Geis cover\" width=\"190\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp class=\"prose\"\u003eAdoption is more than programming.
